    <h1>Welcome to Noah and Aaron's Blackjack!</h1>
    <div >
      <p>
      To play blackjack, you need to create a room or join an existing room. 
      <br>
      Click on the Create a Room button to create a new room. You will be given a room code that you can share with your friends.
      <br>
      Click on the Join a Room button to join a room. You will need to enter the room code that you were given by your friend.
      <br>
      When you join a room, you will be asked to enter your name. This is the name that will show up for other players in the room.
      <br>
      Once everyone has joined the room, the person who created it can start the game.
      <br>
      When it is your turn, you will be dealt two cards. You can choose to hit or stand. If you hit, you will be dealt another card. 
      If you stand, you will not be dealt another card.
      <br>
      The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
      <br>
      If you go over 21, you lose.
      <br>
      If you get 21, you win.
      <br>
      If you get less than 21, you can choose to hit or stand again.
      <br>
      When the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. 
      <br>
      <!-- If you choose to play again, you will be dealt a new hand. -->
      <!-- If you choose not to play again, you will be asked if you want to leave the room. If you choose to leave the room, the room will be deleted. If you choose to stay in the room, the game will end, and you will be returned to the home screen. -->
      When you are returned to the home screen, you will be able to create a new room or join a room.
      <br>
      Have fun!
