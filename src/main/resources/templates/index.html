        <h3>Please note that Google Cloud Platform does not play well with this site. </h3>

        Google Cloud Platform started several instances of the application. This caused glitches and errors for players,
        as the memory stored by one computer would not be stored by another. Some players would not be able to join
        games be because the user would get a different sever than the creator. This was an error that was largely out
        of the developers control. I messed with the server configuration, however I was never fully able to resolve
        that issue.
        Google Cloud Platform also protects it servers by making their storage devices read only for internal programs,
        this prevents people from maliciously overwriting sensitive data. When my code would try to write text files the
        operating system would prevent it, causing the history feature to become disabled.
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> If you would truly like to experience our web application, I recommend me and
            Aaron demonstrating it to you locally (running on my own computer without GCP restrictions). </p>
